# Advent of Code

## 2021

This year, I decide to write my solutions with Jupyter notebooks.

I will mostly use Python when competing, but will reimplement in other languages after that.

The folder structure is:

- 2021
  - Day01.ipynb, Day02.ipynb, ... (Python solutions)
  - kotlin (`#aoc-2021-in-kotlin`)
    - Day01.ipynb, Day02.ipynb, ... (Kotlin solutions)
  - other languages to be added
